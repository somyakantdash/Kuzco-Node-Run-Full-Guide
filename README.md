# Kuzco-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Kuzco is a decentralized project on the Solana blockchain that creates a global network of GPUs for AI inference. It taps into idle compute power from devices with NVIDIA, AMD, or Apple Silicon GPUs to process large language models like Llama3 and Mistral. Contributors earn $KZO points, and developers can access this power through an OpenAI-compatible API, aiming to cut costs—up to 90% less than traditional cloud providers. Launched in March 2024, it’s grown fast, with 8,500 active nodes by July and daily inference requests exceeding 100,000. It’s still in testnet, so expect some instability, but it’s pushing to make AI more affordable and accessible

## Key Features
- Distributed GPU Network: Kuzco harnesses idle GPU power from devices worldwide (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple Silicon) to create a scalable, decentralized cluster for AI inference, focusing on large language models like Llama3 and Mistral.
- Solana Blockchain Integration: Built on Solana, it leverages the blockchain’s high speed, low costs, and transparency to manage and coordinate the network efficiently.
- Cost Efficiency: By using contributed compute power, Kuzco offers inference at up to 90% lower cost compared to traditional cloud providers, making AI more affordable.
- OpenAI-Compatible API: Developers can easily integrate Kuzco into their projects using a familiar, standardized API for accessing AI models.
- Incentives for Contributors: Users earn $KZO points by contributing idle GPU resources, incentivizing participation and rewarding network operators.
- Scalability and Resilience: The distributed architecture allows dynamic scaling and redundancy, ensuring reliability even as demand grows or nodes fail.
- Broad Device Support: Supports macOS and Linux, with compatibility across various GPU types, broadening the pool of potential contributors.

## Airdrop Details
- Testnet Airdrop: Earn $KZO points by contributing GPU power (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple Silicon) on Solana; points convert to tokens post-TGE
- Rewards: $KZO points based on GPU uptime; token price TBD, but network has 10k+ nodes

## Funding 
- Backer: Funded by a16z via Crypto Startup Accelerator (CSX) Fall 2024.
- Amount: Seed funding likely in 500k
